# The Human Menu

The [Human Menu](https://www.github.com/good-labs/human-menu/) project 
provides a prototype for a "human menu," or a selection of items
that contrasts the tendency to mindlessly browse social media or similar
applications. The project is inspired by the problems outlined 
by [The Center for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com/problem/),
specifically that our attentions are captured by addictive "digital slot 
machines" to the detriment of our mental health.

## Why do we need it?

Humans use lists and suggestions to reduce cognitive load. Instead of
offering a list of YouTube videos, endlessly scrolling social media posts,
or phone apps, the Human Menu provides a selection of real world "human" options
such as "Call your Mom," or "Do a puzzle."

## How do I contribute?

The suggested items are read in from [human-menu.csv](human-menu.csv). If you'd
like to add an item with one or more tags, you can add a row to this list.
